Rachel and I drove up to Ucluelet on Friday.  

The weather was sunny and the only cloud and overcast skies we experienced was when we drove through a valley close to Port Alberny.


Saturday morning we went to the lighthouse park for a walk

It's a short trail but it's very pretty

On Sunday before leaving we went to scope out long beach.  We didn't stay very long becuase we chose to forgo the daily parking fee.
Instead we just went down to the water.
